# Pm Highlight

A plugin for [RuneLite](https://runelite.net/) that gives you the ability to highlight private messages from certain players.

Using this plugin you can:
- Highlight the player's name;
- Highlight the message;
- Highlight the log in/out message.

Each one of these highlight can be turned off or on in the menu on the right, simply add a player to the list using the green plus sign:
